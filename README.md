# Picky Picky

Collaboratively choose a restaurant with friends in real-time.

It is incredibly hard to agree on a restaurant to eat at, because everyone is very picky. Instead of asking everyone where they want to eat, instead this asks where people do not want to eat until there is only one possibility left.
